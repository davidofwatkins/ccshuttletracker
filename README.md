================

The Champlain College Shuttle Tracker displays locations of shuttles and buses at Champlain College that are responsible for transportation between campus, Spinner Place, Quarry Hill, and the Gilbane/Lakeside parking lots. It is an unofficial, mobile, and on-the-go alternative to the desktop web tracker, available at shuttle.champlain.edu.
