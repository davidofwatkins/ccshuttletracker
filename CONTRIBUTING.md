If you're interested in contributing to this project—particularly if you're a Champlain student—anything you can do to help would be appreciated, from small fixes to improved UI/UX to complete feature additions!

If you want to help but aren't sure what to add, you can look through [the GiHub Issues](../../issues) for something that strikes your fancy. Otherwise, feel free to file a new issue if you have other ideas. Either way, it's best to leave a comment if you start working on something so you don't conflict with others.

### How to Proceed

1. Leave a comment on [the issue](../../issues) you're going to work on. If it doesn't exist yet, create one!
1. Fork this repo and start working on your contribution.
2. Once you're done, open a pull request back to this repo, targeted toward the `dev` branch.
    1. `master` is always in sync with what's published on the store. If your changes aren't published immediately after they're accepted for whatever reason, they'll stay in `dev` until the next update is released.
    2. Be sure to add your name to the app's about page if you'd like me to!
3. Respond to any comments left on your pull request.
4. I'll merge in your changes and publish an update to the play store.
